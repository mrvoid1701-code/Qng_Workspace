## Claim Statement

Persistent clusters with high stability Σ\SigmaΣ constitute emergent attractor states within the node dynamics, corresponding to physical objects observed at macroscopic scales.

## Assumptions

- A1. Node dynamics generate a range of configurations through local interactions and fluctuations.
- A2. Stability determines the persistence probability of configurations.
- A3. Dynamical attractors correspond to configurations that remain stable under perturbations.
- A4. Physical objects correspond to clusters maintaining stability above a critical threshold over time.
- A5. Macroscopic identity emerges from sustained persistence of attractor configurations.

## Mathematical Form

- Cluster stability:
- Σcluster=F({Σi}i∈cluster)\Sigma_{\text{cluster}} = F(\{\Sigma_i\}_{i \in \text{cluster}})Σcluster=F({Σi}i∈cluster)
- Attractor condition:
- dΣclusterdt≈0andΣcluster≥Σmin⁡\frac{d\Sigma_{\text{cluster}}}{dt} \approx 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \Sigma_{\text{cluster}} \ge \Sigma_{\min}dtdΣcluster≈0andΣcluster≥Σmin
- Persistence over time:
- Σcluster(t)≥Σmin⁡∀t∈[t0,t1]\Sigma_{\text{cluster}}(t) \ge \Sigma_{\min} \quad \forall t \in [t_0, t_1]Σcluster(t)≥Σmin∀t∈[t0,t1]
- Attractor basin representation:
- A={N∣U(N)→Nstable}\mathcal{A} = \{ N \mid U(N) \rightarrow N_{\text{stable}} \}A={N∣U(N)→Nstable}
- Effective object representation:
- Object≡Persistent attractor cluster\text{Object} \equiv \text{Persistent attractor cluster}Object≡Persistent attractor cluster

## Potential Falsifier

- Experimental evidence showing physical objects without persistent stability properties.
- Observations incompatible with attractor-based persistence mechanisms.
- Demonstration that stable configurations cannot arise from node dynamics.
- Empirical necessity for alternative mechanisms independent of stability or attractors.

## Evidence / Notes

- Conceptually consistent with attractor dynamics in nonlinear and complex systems.
- Provides a mechanism for emergence of persistent physical entities.
- Analogous to stable structures observed in many-body systems and condensed matter physics.
- Empirical validation depends on reproducing known persistence and stability of physical objects.

## Next Action

- Derive stability conditions for attractor formation from node update rules.
- Connect cluster properties to measurable physical parameters (mass, size, lifetime).
- Simulate attractor formation and persistence in node networks.
- Compare predictions with observed physical object behavior.
