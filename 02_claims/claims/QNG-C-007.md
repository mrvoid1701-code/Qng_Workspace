## Claim Statement

Each fundamental node is fully characterized by a state triple Ni=(Vi,χi,ϕi)N_i = (V_i, \chi_i, \phi_i)Ni=(Vi,χi,ϕi), representing discrete volume, informational memory (Straton content), and interaction phase, respectively.

## Assumptions

- A1. Nodes are the fundamental units of the physical substrate.
- A2. All observable physical properties derive from node states and their relational interactions.
- A3. The variables ViV_iVi, χi\chi_iχi, and ϕi\phi_iϕi are sufficient to describe node behavior at the fundamental level.
- A4. Node states evolve according to local update dynamics influenced by neighboring nodes and fluctuations.
- A5. Macroscopic observables emerge from collective configurations of these node state variables.

## Mathematical Form

- Node definition:
- Ni=(Vi,χi,ϕi)N_i = (V_i, \chi_i, \phi_i)Ni=(Vi,χi,ϕi)
- where:
- Vi∈N⋅V0V_i \in \mathbb{N} \cdot V_0Vi∈N⋅V0 — discrete volume assignment
- χi=mic\chi_i = \frac{m_i}{c}χi=cmi — informational memory (Straton load)
- ϕi∈Φ\phi_i \in \Phiϕi∈Φ — interaction phase state
- State evolution:
- Ni(t+1)=U ⁣(Ni(t),{Nj(t)}j∈Neighbors(i),ηi(t))N_i(t+1) = U\!\left(N_i(t), \{N_j(t)\}_{j \in \text{Neighbors}(i)}, \eta_i(t)\right)Ni(t+1)=U(Ni(t),{Nj(t)}j∈Neighbors(i),ηi(t))
- Cluster state representation:
- Ncluster=F({Ni}i∈cluster)N_{\text{cluster}} = F(\{N_i\}_{i \in \text{cluster}})Ncluster=F({Ni}i∈cluster)

## Potential Falsifier

- Experimental evidence requiring additional fundamental node variables beyond Vi,χi,ϕiV_i, \chi_i, \phi_iVi,χi,ϕi to describe physical behavior.
- Observations incompatible with the Straton formulation χ=m/c\chi = m/cχ=m/c.
- Demonstration that node dynamics cannot reproduce known physical phenomena using only this state triple.
- Empirical necessity of independent degrees of freedom not derivable from these variables.

## Evidence / Notes

- Conceptually motivated by the need for minimal sufficient state variables describing volume, inertia/memory, and interaction dynamics.
- Analogous to state representations in lattice and network-based physical models.
- Compatibility with known physics depends on successful derivation of emergent fields and dynamics from these variables.
- Currently theoretical; empirical support is indirect through model predictions.

## Next Action

- Derive emergent physical quantities (mass, energy, fields) explicitly from node variables.
- Test whether the state triple is sufficient to reproduce known gravitational and inertial phenomena.
- Explore possible extensions if additional degrees of freedom become necessary.
- Implement numerical simulations of node dynamics using this state representation.
