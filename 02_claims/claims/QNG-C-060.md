## Claim Statement

Spacecraft flyby and deep-space anomalies arise from a directional lag acceleration governed by the interaction between spacecraft velocity and spatial gradients of the stability field, producing measurable deviations from classical gravitational predictions.

## Assumptions

- A1. Gravitational response is mediated by the stability field Σ\SigmaΣ with finite relaxation delay τ\tauτ.
- A2. Moving spacecraft experience residual accelerations due to lag between instantaneous configuration and stability-field adaptation.
- A3. The magnitude and direction of the anomaly depend on spacecraft velocity orientation relative to stability gradients.
- A4. Perturbative approximations are valid for small lag relative to system scales.
- A5. Observed anomalies are not fully explained by conventional forces alone.

## Mathematical Form

- Residual acceleration law:
- a⃗lag≈−τ (v⃗⋅∇)∇Σ\vec{a}_{\text{lag}} \approx - \tau \, (\vec{v} \cdot \nabla)\nabla \Sigmaalag≈−τ(v⋅∇)∇Σ
- Magnitude dependence:
- ∣a⃗lag∣∝τ ∣v⃗∣ ∣∇2Σ∣ cos⁡θ|\vec{a}_{\text{lag}}| \propto \tau \, |\vec{v}| \, |\nabla^2 \Sigma| \, \cos \theta∣alag∣∝τ∣v∣∣∇2Σ∣cosθ
- Directional factor:
- cos⁡θ=v⃗⋅∇Σ∣v⃗∣ ∣∇Σ∣\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \nabla \Sigma}{|\vec{v}| \, |\nabla \Sigma|}cosθ=∣v∣∣∇Σ∣v⋅∇Σ
- Effective acceleration:
- a⃗eff=a⃗classical+a⃗lag\vec{a}_{\text{eff}} = \vec{a}_{\text{classical}} + \vec{a}_{\text{lag}}aeff=aclassical+alag
- Trajectory perturbation:
- Δv⃗∼∫a⃗lag dt\Delta \vec{v} \sim \int \vec{a}_{\text{lag}} \, dtΔv∼∫alagdt

## Potential Falsifier

- Experimental confirmation that flyby and deep-space anomalies are fully explained by conventional physics.
- Observations incompatible with any velocity–gradient–dependent acceleration.
- Demonstration that directional lag effects cannot occur within physical constraints.
- Empirical necessity for alternative explanations independent of lag dynamics.

## Evidence / Notes

- Provides a unified explanation for multiple spacecraft anomalies.
- Predicts orientation-dependent effects distinguishable from isotropic forces.
- Conceptually consistent with delayed-response gravitational dynamics.
- Empirical validation depends on comparison with high-precision trajectory data.

## Next Action

- Derive quantitative predictions for specific spacecraft missions.
- Compare predictions with historical trajectory data.
- Identify regimes where lag effects are maximized.
- Develop simulations incorporating directional lag acceleration.
